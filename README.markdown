What are nested sets?
---------------------

Nested sets or [Nested Set Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model) is
a way to effectively store hierarchical data in a relational table. From wikipedia:

> The nested set model is to number the nodes according to a tree traversal,
> which visits each node twice, assigning numbers in the order of visiting, and
> at both visits. This leaves two numbers for each node, which are stored as two
> attributes. Querying becomes inexpensive: hierarchy membership can be tested by
> comparing these numbers. Updating requires renumbering and is therefore expensive.

### Applications

NSM shows good performance when tree is updated rarely. It is tuned to be fast for
getting related nodes. It'is ideally suited for building multi-depth menu or
categories for shop.

Documentation
-------------

Suppose that we have a model `Category`; a `$node` variable is an instance of that model
and the node that we are manipulating. It can be a fresh model or one from database.

### Relationships

Node has following relationships that are fully functional and can be eagerly loaded:

-   Node belongs to `parent`
-   Node has many `children`
-   Node has many `ancestors`
-   Node has many `descendants`

### Inserting nodes

Moving and inserting nodes includes several database queries, so it is
highly recommended to use transactions.

__IMPORTANT!__ As of v4.2.0 transaction is not automatically started

Another important note is that __structural manipulations are deferred__ until you
hit `save` on model (some methods implicitly call `save` and return boolean result
of the operation).

If model is successfully saved it doesn't mean that node was moved. If your application
depends on whether the node has actually changed its position, use `hasMoved` method:

```php
if ($node->save()) {
    $moved = $node->hasMoved();
}
```

#### Creating nodes

When you simply creating a node, it will be appended to the end of the tree:

```php
Category::create($attributes); // Saved as root
```

```php
$node = new Category($attributes);
$node->save(); // Saved as root
```

In this case the node is considered a _root_ which means that it doesn't have a parent.

#### Making a root from existing node

```php
// #1 Implicit save
$node->saveAsRoot();

// #2 Explicit save
$node->makeRoot()->save();
```

The node will be appended to the end of the tree.

#### Appending and prepending to the specified parent

If you want to make node a child of other node, you can make it last or first child.

*In following examples, `$parent` is some existing node.*

There are few ways to append a node:

```php
// #1 Using deferred insert
$node->appendToNode($parent)->save();

// #2 Using parent node
$parent->appendNode($node);

// #3 Using parent's children relationship
$parent->children()->create($attributes);

// #5 Using node's parent relationship
$node->parent()->associate($parent)->save();

// #6 Using the parent attribute
$node->parent_id = $parent->id;
$node->save();

// #7 Using static method
Category::create($attributes, $parent);
```

And only a couple ways to prepend:

```php
// #1
$node->prependToNode($parent)->save();

// #2
$parent->prependNode($node);
```

#### Inserting before or after specified node

You can make `$node` to be a neighbor of the `$neighbor` node using following methods:

*`$neighbor` must exists, target node can be fresh. If target node exists,
it will be moved to the new position and parent will be changed if it's required.*

```php
# Explicit save
$node->afterNode($neighbor)->save();
$node->beforeNode($neighbor)->save();

# Implicit save
$node->insertAfterNode($neighbor);
$node->insertBeforeNode($neighbor);
```

#### Building a tree from array

When using static method `create` on node, it checks whether attributes contains
`children` key. If it does, it creates more nodes recursively.

```php
$node = Category::create([
    'name' => 'Foo',

    'children' => [
        [
            'name' => 'Bar',

            'children' => [
                [ 'name' => 'Baz' ],
            ],
        ],
    ],
]);
```

`$node->children` now contains a list of created child nodes.

#### Rebuilding a tree from array

You can easily rebuild a tree. This is useful for mass-changing the structure of
the tree.

```php
Category::rebuildTree($data, $delete);
```

`$data` is an array of nodes:

```php
$data = [
    [ 'id' => 1, 'name' => 'foo', 'children' => [ ... ] ],
    [ 'name' => 'bar' ],
];
```

There is an id specified for node with the name of `foo` which means that existing
node will be filled and saved. If node is not exists `ModelNotFoundException` is
thrown. Also, this node has `children` specified which is also an array of nodes;
they will be processed in the same manner and saved as children of node `foo`.

Node `bar` has no primary key specified, so it will be created.

`$delete` shows whether to delete nodes that are already exists but not present
in `$data`. By default, nodes aren't deleted.

##### Rebuilding a subtree

As of 4.2.8 you can rebuild a subtree:

```php
Category::rebuildSubtree($root, $data);
```

This constraints tree rebuilding to descendants of `$root` node.

### Retrieving nodes

*In some cases we will use an `$id` variable which is an id of the target node.*

#### Ancestors and descendants

Ancestors make a chain of parents to the node. Helpful for displaying breadcrumbs
to the current category.

Descendants are all nodes in a sub tree, i.e. children of node, children of
children, etc.

Both ancestors and descendants can be eagerly loaded.

```php
// Accessing ancestors
$node->ancestors;

// Accessing descendants
$node->descendants;
```

It is possible to load ancestors and descendants using custom query:

```php
$result = Category::ancestorsOf($id);
$result = Category::ancestorsAndSelf($id);
$result = Category::descendantsOf($id);
$result = Category::descendantsAndSelf($id);
```

In most cases, you need your ancestors to be ordered by the level:

```php
$result = Category::defaultOrder()->ancestorsOf($id);
```

A collection of ancestors can be eagerly loaded:

```php
$categories = Category::with('ancestors')->paginate(30);

// in view for breadcrumbs:
@foreach($categories as $i => $category)
    <small>{{ $category->ancestors->count() ? implode(' > ', $category->ancestors->pluck('name')->toArray()) : 'Top Level' }}</small><br>
    {{ $category->name }}
@endforeach
```

#### Siblings

Siblings are nodes that have same parent.

```php
$result = $node->getSiblings();

$result = $node->siblings()->get();
```

To get only next siblings:

```php
// Get a sibling that is immediately after the node
$result = $node->getNextSibling();

// Get all siblings that are after the node
$result = $node->getNextSiblings();

// Get all siblings using a query
$result = $node->nextSiblings()->get();
```

To get previous siblings:

```php
// Get a sibling that is immediately before the node
$result = $node->getPrevSibling();

// Get all siblings that are before the node
$result = $node->getPrevSiblings();

// Get all siblings using a query
$result = $node->prevSiblings()->get();
```

#### Getting related models from other table

Imagine that each category `has many` goods. I.e. `HasMany` relationship is established.
How can you get all goods of `$category` and every its descendant? Easy!

```php
// Get ids of descendants
$categories = $category->descendants()->pluck('id');

// Include the id of category itself
$categories[] = $category->getKey();

// Get goods
$goods = Goods::whereIn('category_id', $categories)->get();
```

#### Including node depth

If you need to know at which level the node is:

```php
$result = Category::withDepth()->find($id);

$depth = $result->depth;
```

Root node will be at level 0. Children of root nodes will have a level of 1, etc.

To get nodes of specified level, you can apply `having` constraint:

```php
$result = Category::withDepth()->having('depth', '=', 1)->get();
```

__IMPORTANT!__ This will not work in database strict mode

#### Default order

All nodes are strictly organized internally. By default, no order is
applied, so nodes may appear in random order and this doesn't affect
displaying a tree. You can order nodes by alphabet or other index.

But in some cases hierarchical order is essential. It is required for
retrieving ancestors and can be used to order menu items.

To apply tree order `defaultOrder` method is used:

```php
$result = Category::defaultOrder()->get();
```

You can get nodes in reversed order:

```php
$result = Category::reversed()->get();
```

To shift node up or down inside parent to affect default order:

```php
$bool = $node->down();
$bool = $node->up();

// Shift node by 3 siblings
$bool = $node->down(3);
```

The result of the operation is boolean value of whether the node has changed its
position.

#### Constraints

Various constraints that can be applied to the query builder:

-   __whereIsRoot()__ to get only root nodes;
-   __hasParent()__ to get non-root nodes;
-   __whereIsLeaf()__ to get only leaves;
-   __hasChildren()__ to get non-leave nodes;
-   __whereIsAfter($id)__ to get every node (not just siblings) that are after a node
    with specified id;
-   __whereIsBefore($id)__ to get every node that is before a node with specified id.

Descendants constraints:

```php
$result = Category::whereDescendantOf($node)->get();
$result = Category::whereNotDescendantOf($node)->get();
$result = Category::orWhereDescendantOf($node)->get();
$result = Category::orWhereNotDescendantOf($node)->get();
$result = Category::whereDescendantAndSelf($id)->get();

// Include target node into result set
$result = Category::whereDescendantOrSelf($node)->get();
```

Ancestor constraints:

```php
$result = Category::whereAncestorOf($node)->get();
$result = Category::whereAncestorOrSelf($id)->get();
```

`$node` can be either a primary key of the model or model instance.

#### Building a tree

After getting a set of nodes, you can convert it to tree. For example:

```php
$tree = Category::get()->toTree();
```

This will fill `parent` and `children` relationships on every node in the set and
you can render a tree using recursive algorithm:

```php
$nodes = Category::get()->toTree();

$traverse = function ($categories, $prefix = '-') use (&$traverse) {
    foreach ($categories as $category) {
        echo PHP_EOL.$prefix.' '.$category->name;

        $traverse($category->children, $prefix.'-');
    }
};

$traverse($nodes);
```

This will output something like this:

```
- Root
-- Child 1
--- Sub child 1
-- Child 2
- Another root
```

##### Building flat tree

Also, you can build a flat tree: a list of nodes where child nodes are immediately
after parent node. This is helpful when you get nodes with custom order
(i.e. alphabetically) and don't want to use recursion to iterate over your nodes.

```php
$nodes = Category::get()->toFlatTree();
```

Previous example will output:

```
Root
Child 1
Sub child 1
Child 2
Another root
```

##### Getting a subtree

Sometimes you don't need whole tree to be loaded and just some subtree of specific node.
It is show in following example:

```php
$root = Category::descendantsAndSelf($rootId)->toTree()->first();
```

In a single query we are getting a root of a subtree and all of its
descendants that are accessible via `children` relation.

If you don't need `$root` node itself, do following instead:

```php
$tree = Category::descendantsOf($rootId)->toTree($rootId);
```

### Deleting nodes

To delete a node:

```php
$node->delete();
```

**IMPORTANT!** Any descendant that node has will also be deleted!

**IMPORTANT!** Nodes are required to be deleted as models, **don't** try do delete them using a query like so:

```php
Category::where('id', '=', $id)->delete();
```

This will break the tree!

`SoftDeletes` trait is supported, also on model level.

### Helper methods

To check if node is a descendant of other node:

```php
$bool = $node->isDescendantOf($parent);
```

To check whether the node is a root:

```php
$bool = $node->isRoot();
```

Other checks:

*   `$node->isChildOf($other);`
*   `$node->isAncestorOf($other);`
*   `$node->isSiblingOf($other);`
*   `$node->isLeaf()`

### Checking consistency

You can check whether a tree is broken (i.e. has some structural errors):

```php
$bool = Category::isBroken();
```

It is possible to get error statistics:

```php
$data = Category::countErrors();
```

It will return an array with following keys:

-   `oddness` -- the number of nodes that have wrong set of `lft` and `rgt` values
-   `duplicates` -- the number of nodes that have same `lft` or `rgt` values
-   `wrong_parent` -- the number of nodes that have invalid `parent_id` value that
    doesn't correspond to `lft` and `rgt` values
-   `missing_parent` -- the number of nodes that have `parent_id` pointing to
    node that doesn't exists

#### Fixing tree

Since v3.1 tree can now be fixed. Using inheritance info from `parent_id` column,
proper `_lft` and `_rgt` values are set for every node.

```php
Node::fixTree();
```

### Scoping

Imagine you have `Menu` model and `MenuItems`. There is a one-to-many relationship
set up between these models. `MenuItem` has `menu_id` attribute for joining models
together. `MenuItem` incorporates nested sets. It is obvious that you would want to
process each tree separately based on `menu_id` attribute. In order to do so, you
need to specify this attribute as scope attribute:

```php
protected function getScopeAttributes()
{
    return [ 'menu_id' ];
}
```

But now, in order to execute some custom query, you need to provide attributes
that are used for scoping:

```php
MenuItem::scoped([ 'menu_id' => 5 ])->withDepth()->get(); // OK
MenuItem::descendantsOf($id)->get(); // WRONG: returns nodes from other scope
MenuItem::scoped([ 'menu_id' => 5 ])->fixTree(); // OK
```

When requesting nodes using model instance, scopes applied automatically based
on the attributes of that model:

```php
$node = MenuItem::findOrFail($id);

$node->siblings()->withDepth()->get(); // OK
```

To get scoped query builder using instance:

```php
$node->newScopedQuery();
```

#### Scoping and eager loading

Always use scoped query when eager loading:

```php
MenuItem::scoped([ 'menu_id' => 5])->with('descendants')->findOrFail($id); // OK
MenuItem::with('descendants')->findOrFail($id); // WRONG
```

Requirements
------------

- PHP >= 5.4
- Laravel >= 4.1

It is highly suggested to use database that supports transactions (like MySql's InnoDb)
to secure a tree from possible corruption.

Installation
------------

To install the package, in terminal:

```
composer require kalnoy/nestedset
```

### Setting up from scratch

#### The schema

For Laravel 5.5 and above users:

```php
Schema::create('table', function (Blueprint $table) {
    ...
    $table->nestedSet();
});

// To drop columns
Schema::table('table', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->dropNestedSet();
});
```

For prior Laravel versions:

```php
...
use Kalnoy\Nestedset\NestedSet;

Schema::create('table', function (Blueprint $table) {
    ...
    NestedSet::columns($table);
});
```

To drop columns:

```php
...
use Kalnoy\Nestedset\NestedSet;

Schema::table('table', function (Blueprint $table) {
    NestedSet::dropColumns($table);
});
```

#### The model

Your model should use `Kalnoy\Nestedset\NodeTrait` trait to enable nested sets:

```php
use Kalnoy\Nestedset\NodeTrait;

class Foo extends Model {
    use NodeTrait;
}
```

### Migrating existing data

#### Migrating from other nested set extension

If your previous extension used different set of columns, you just need to override
following methods on your model class:

```php
public function getLftName()
{
    return 'left';
}

public function getRgtName()
{
    return 'right';
}

public function getParentIdName()
{
    return 'parent';
}

// Specify parent id attribute mutator
public function setParentAttribute($value)
{
    $this->setParentIdAttribute($value);
}
```

#### Migrating from basic parentage info

If your tree contains `parent_id` info, you need to add two columns to your schema:

```php
$table->unsignedInteger('_lft');
$table->unsignedInteger('_rgt');
```

After [setting up your model](#the-model) you only need to fix the tree to fill
`_lft` and `_rgt` columns:

```php
MyModel::fixTree();
```
